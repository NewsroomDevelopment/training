# Week 2 Deliverable

You are moving the HTML/CSS you created to React!

To get started, in your terminal, run:
```bash
npx create-react-app week-2 --use-npm
```

then,
```bash
cd week-2
npm start
```

You should see your app at `localhost:3000`

### Suggestions
Break your App up into three components:
- Navbar.jsx
- CreateSource.jsx
- Source.jsx

Each of those folders will contain code for each part of your app.

Use props to dynamically pass in the name, email, and number of each source.

Put your CSS inside the `App.css` file.

You should end up with something that looks exactly the same as this week's deliverable, just in React.
