## Push everything to Github

- Click the + button in the top right corner of the page, click New Repository, 
then copy the first bit of code into the terminal while you are at the root directory 
of your codebase

- To add new changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m ":smile:"
git push origin main
```

Have everything pushed to a repo by the next meeting!
